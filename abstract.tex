In this paper we argue that there is a value in providing a 
unified view of modeling and programming. Models are meant to
describe a system at a high level of abstraction for the purpose of
human understanding and analysis. Programs, on the other hand, 
are meant for execution. However, programming languages are 
becoming increasingly higher-level, with convenient notation for 
concepts that in the past would only be reserved formal 
specification languages. This leads to the observation, that  
programming languages could be used for modeling, if only 
appropriate modifications were made to these languages.
At the same time, model-based engineering formalisms such as UML 
and SysML are highly popular in engineering communities due to 
their graphical nature. However, these communities are,
due to the complex nature of these formalisms, 
struggling to find grounds in textual formalisms with proper 
semantics. A unified view of modeling and programming may
provide a common ground. The paper illustrates these points 
with selected examples comparing models and programs.
